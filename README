This project is the begin of a collection of utilities which make use
of the Liquid Feedback API to obtain information about changed and new
issues or initiatives.

All changes can be mailed to a single address at the moment.

System Requirements
===================

To use these tools, you need the following software installed:
1. Perl
2. MySQL
3. the CPAN Modules LWP::Simple, XML::EasyOBJ and Crypt::SSLeay

Installation
============
1. Unpack the archive into a directory
2. copy the file config.pm.sample to config.pm
3. edit the file config.pm and adapt the variables to your system environment
4. run the script install.sh

Usage
=====
The main work is currently done with the script sync_from_server.pl

Call this script with no arguments will fetch all new initiatives and issues
from the LQFB-Server and synchronize the data with the local database

You can add the argument "mail" to the script, e.g.
./sync_from_server.pl mail
which writes an email for each new or changed initiative/issue to the
reciever, which is given in the variable $MAIL_RECIEVER in the file config.pm.
It is intended that you put this call in the crontab of a unix machine and
call this script every 15 minutes. The given email address can then be a
mailing list or something similiar, so everybody who joins the mailing list
will be informed about new issues or initiatives.
