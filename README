This project is the begin of a collection of utilities which make use
of the Liquid Feedback API to obtain information about changed and new
issues or initiatives.

All changes can be mailed to a single address at the moment.

System Requirements
===================

To use these tools, you need the following software installed:
1. Perl
2. MySQL (if you want to store the stuff in a database)
3. the CPAN Modules LWP::Simple, XML::EasyOBJ and Crypt::SSLeay

Installation
============
* WARNING *
The installation script will drop any existing database with the name given in
the file config.pm!
1. Unpack the archive into a directory (or clone the source with git,
which is the recommended way).
2. copy the file config.pm.sample to config.pm
3. edit the file config.pm and adapt the variables to your system environment
4. run the script install.sh (only required if database access is needed)

Usage
=====
The main work is currently done with the script sync_from_server.pl

Call this script with no arguments will fetch all new initiatives and issues
from the LQFB-Server and synchronize the data with the local database

You can add the argument "mail" to the script, e.g.
./sync_from_server.pl mail
which writes an email for each new or changed initiative/issue to the
reciever, which is given in the variable $MAIL_RECIEVER in the file config.pm.
It is intended that you put this call in the crontab of a unix machine and
call this script every 15 minutes. The given email address can then be a
mailing list or something similiar, so everybody who joins the mailing list
will be informed about new issues or initiatives.

Another script, simple_check_script.pl , is provided which does not need
database access.

How to deal with updates
========================
The tools will be updated in an irregular way. 

1. To install an updated version
of these tools you have the following options:
a) If you got the source with git just move to the source directory and enter
git pull
into you command line.
b) Download a new archive and unpack it to the same directory. Replace all chaned files
2. After installing the updated version there have to be changes made in the
database. This is done by a migration script. So open a command prompt, move to
the source directory and enter
./migrate.sh into the command line.
